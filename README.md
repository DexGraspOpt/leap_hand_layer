# Leap_Hand_Layer
Toolkit for differentiable hand kinematics layer based on pytorch_kinematics[(https://github.com/UM-ARM-Lab/pytorch_kinematics)].

## Introduction

This toolkit is developed based on the differentiable kinematics layer which was implemented in our previous work DVGG[2] and DexFG[1]. In fact, it is updated from manually D-H parameter extracting to automatic kinematic phrase with the great pytorch-kinematics package.
